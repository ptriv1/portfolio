                <p class="paragraph"> Hi, I'm Pia!  Welcome to my portfolio website.  Currently I work full-time and attend a part-time boot camp for those who want to learn web development.  We are learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more that relate to current technologies.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraph">I earned a BBA from a local university and a BA from a different university.  Favorite classes included courses in finance, history, and foreign languages.</p>
        
                <p class="paragraph">In my spare time I enjoy reading a wide variety of books, spending time with family, and watching old and new favorites.  Occasionally I also enjoy knitting and made hats and scarves.  If the weather is nice I also enjoy sitting outside and listening to wildlife.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraph">This website is a place for you to view my newest projects.</p>
